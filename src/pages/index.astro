        The GPC 2023 is a city-wide scavenger hunt for any youth,
        6th-12th grade. The event <strong>begins at 6pm sharp</strong>
         on the evening of
        <strong
          >Friday, October 27, 2023 at CrossLife Community Church
          (1410 Old Brook Rd, at Rio Road)</strong
        >, and will end by about 11pm. If there's inclement weather on
        Friday night, we will postpone until the next night, on
        <strong>Saturday the 28th</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Teams of participants, consisting of 6-12 people with 1-2
        adult drivers/chaperones, will make their way throughout the
        evening to different waypoints throughout Charlottesville,
        each of which are well-known, safe public places. At each
        waypoint teams will have to work together to solve puzzles,
        complete challenges, and earn points by collecting artifacts
        along the way.
