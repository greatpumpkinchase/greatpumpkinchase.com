      What is the Great Pumpkin Chase?
    </h3>
    <p>
      The GPC 2023 is a city-wide scavenger hunt for any youth, 6th-
      12th grade. The event begins at 6pm sharp on the evening of
      Friday, October 27, 2023 at CrossLife Community Church (1410 Old
      Brook Rd, at Rio Road), and will end by about 11pm. If there's
      inclement weather on Friday night, we will postpone until the
      next night, on Saturday the 28th.
    </p>

    <p>
      Teams of participants, consisting of 6-12 people with 1-2 adult
      drivers/chaperones, will make their way throughout the evening
      to different waypoints throughout Charlottesville, each of which
      are well-known, safe public places. At each waypoint teams will
      have to work together to solve puzzles, complete challenges, and
      earn points by collecting artifacts along the way.
