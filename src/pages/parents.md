# Parent Info

Our goal is to create a safe environment where your student can hear the message of the Gospel and have a blast as they participate with their friends in the Great Pumpkin Chase 2025 event.

## What is the Great Pumpkin Chase?

The GPC 2025 is a city-wide scavenger hunt for any youth, 6th - 12th grade. The event begins at 6pm sharp on the evening of Saturday, October 25, 2025 at CrossLife Community Church (1410 Old Brook Rd, at Rio Road), and will end at 11pm.

Teams consisting of 6-12 youth and 1-2 adult chaperones will make their way to different waypoints throughout Charlottesville. The waypoints are carefully selected to be well-known and safe public places. Waypoint Sentinels guard these locations as teams come and go in order to ensure safety and to assist the adventurers on their chase. At each waypoint teams will work together to solve puzzles, complete challenges, and earn points by collecting artifacts along the way.

Directly after the chase (9:15pm) all teams will regroup at Crosslife Community Church, where Youth Leader, Luke Forister, will share a message from the Bible. The evening will wrap up with snacks, music, funny videos of the teams doing their challenges, and epic prizes for the three teams who score the most points.

Students may register on the registration page. We are also enlisting the help of adult volunteers! If youâ€™re interested in being a part of this event, let us know by [signing up here](/volunteer/register).
